    "\n",
    "We study how the Input Mode Cleaner (IMC) affects laser frequency noise in a realistic interferometric gravitational-wave detector model. We begin with a dual-recycled Fabry–Pérot Michelson interferometer (DRFPMI), that is, a Michelson interferometer with Fabry–Pérot arm cavities, a Power Recycling Mirror (PRM), and a Signal Recycling Mirror (SRM). At first, the interferometer has no Input Mode Cleaner (IMC) and no Output Mode Cleaner (OMC). We then add the IMC and re-evaluate the system’s response to laser frequency fluctuations.\n",

    "\n",
    "Gravitational-wave interferometers such as LIGO and Virgo are extremely sensitive to laser frequency noise. If unfiltered, this noise can mimic a true gravitational-wave signal by changing the phase of the light that reaches the detectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about laser frequency noise, we mean that the laser’s optical frequency is not perfectly constant in time, but oscillates slightly around its nominal (central) value. If the laser normally emits light at frequency $\\nu_0$, then a sinusoidal modulation at a frequency $\\nu_m$ and with a modulation depth $\\Delta \\nu$ can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\nu(t)= \n",

    "### 3. The Input Mode Cleaner \n",
    "\n",
    "You may already be familiar with linear optical cavities, such as the Fabry–Pérot (FP) type, which consist of two mirrors. In such cavities, light bounces back and forth along a straight path, and the design is mainly used to amplify optical power. Here, we deal with a triangular cavity, the IMC, formed by three mirrors (denoted MC1, MC2, and MC3) and three optical paths between them (L12, L13, L23). Some key differences between linear and triangular cavities are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a linear cavity, the reflected beam propagates back along the same axis as the incoming beam; in a triangular cavity, the reflected light exits through a different port, so the spatial separation between input and reflected beams makes control easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear cavities are more power-efficient, since each round trip involves only two reflections (reduced losses).\n",
    "\n",
    "- A triangular geometry allows a long optical path to be folded into a smaller physical space. This is essential since otherwise the setup would be too large, and too expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The IMC is placed between the laser and the main interferometer. Its purpose is to act as the first stage of beam cleaning, by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- filtering out higher-order spatial modes, \n",
    "- reducing the laser frequency noise, a feature that we explore in detail in this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, the IMC acts as a low-pass filter for the laser’s frequency noise: it transmits the slow variations but suppresses the rapid ones, so the output beam has reduced high-frequency noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How “rapid” a variation is depends on how long the light remains stored in the cavity. The storage time quantifies how long the optical field remains stored in the cavity before decaying to 1/e of its original value; during that time, each newly arriving wavefront overlaps and interferes with the field already stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "- When the laser frequency (and therefore the instantaneous phase) varies slowly (low $f_{\\text{sig}}$), each new wavefront that enters is almost in phase with the ones that are already stored; the many reflections add coherently and intracavity field builds up. \n",
    "\n",
    "- When the laser frequency varies rapidly (high $f_{\\text{sig}}$), however, the phase of each new wavefront is already significantly different from the phase of the waves already circulating. Then we endup with an intracavity field that has many waves with different frequencies, that can interfere destructively. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compute the average number of round trips a photon makes before escaping, as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  N= \\dfrac{ \\text{ time spent inside}}{\\text{time per round trip }}= \n",

    "A mirror component has only two ports. That means we can only connect one incoming and one outgoing beam, which is perfect for a linear cavity, in which light bounces back and forth between the two mirrors. To model a triangular cavity in Finesse, we use beam splitter components, because they provide multiple ports (p1,p2,p3,p4, oriented clockwise), allowing us to connect the optical paths properly and close the cavity loop."

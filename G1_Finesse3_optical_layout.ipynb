    "### 1. Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "Current gravitational-wave detectors are based on the Michelson interferometer, the simplest configuration capable of measuring tiny differential arm-length changes. Over time, this basic topology has been extended and refined through several improvements. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we compare the Michelson setup with successive optical designs to see how each step changes the interferometer’s transfer functions and sensitivity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The configurations under study are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Michelson Interferometer (MI). This is the simplest layout: a beam splitter and two perpendicular arms with mirrors at the ends.\n",
    "2) Fabry-Perot Michelson Interferometer (FPMI). Here we have a partially transmitting mirror at the start of each arm, so each arm becomes a resonant optical cavity, also known as Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity. As a result, the light travels a longer optical path inside the arms. \n",
    "3) Power Recycling Fabry-Perot Michelson Interferometer (PRFPMI). With respect to the previous layout, here an additional mirror, the Power Recycling Mirror (PRM) is placed between the laser and the beam splitter. This mirror forms a resonant cavity with the rest of interferometer, called Power Recycling Cavity (PRC). Since a large part of the incident power is reflected by the interferometer towards the laser, the PRM allows for increased\n",
    "circulating power, without the need to boost the input power. This technique, known as power recycling, effectively \"recycles\" light that would otherwise be lost.\n",
    "4) Dual Recycling Fabry-Perot Michelson Interferometer (DRFPMI). In addition to Fabry Perot and Power Recycling cavities,  we have the Signal Recycling Mirror (SRM), placed between the beam splitter and the photodiode. It also forms an optical resonator with the interferometer, called Signal Recycling Cavity (SRC). By carefully adjusting the SRM’s position, the resonance of this cavity can be tuned to specific frequencies, enhancing the detector’s sensitivity to specific types of gravitational waves. Via the SRM we can also narrow or broaden the frequency range of the detector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. From noise sources to strain sensitivity\n",
    "\n",
    "For any noise source that affects the detector output, we can estimate its impact on strain sensitivity by comparing how strongly the interferometer responds to that noise versus to a real gravitational-wave signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hs(f)** — signal transfer function: response of the detector output power to a gravitational-wave strain [W/h]  \n",
    "- **Hn(f)** — noise transfer function: response of the detector output power to a specific technical noise source (e.g. laser frequency noise). Units: W / (unit of noise); for laser frequency noise, units are W / Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nn(f)** — amplitude spectral density (ASD) of that noise source [$\\text{unit}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$]\n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding **strain-equivalent noise**  expresses how strongly a given noise source mimics a real gravitational-wave signal at the detector output, and is given by:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_h(f) = \\frac{|H_n(f)|}{|H_s(f)|} \\, N_n(f)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Noise sources: quantum noise \n",
    "\n",
    "A complex instrument such as a GW detector can be affected by many noise sources that can mask or mimic a gravitational wave signal. In this notebook, we look at a few representative examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantum noise** is an umbrella term used to refer to multiple complicated effects in the interferometer. However, they are all a direct consequence of the photonic nature of the light field, their associated Poissonian statistics, and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The details are unimportant for our modeling tasks, but the interested reader may find this [review article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1706) informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Finesse the `qnoised` detector can be used to directly compute the quantum noise amplitude spectral density at the output port of an interferometer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of `qn` has the form $N_q(f) |H_p(f)|$, where $N_q$ is the amplitude spectral density of the quantum noise and $H_p$ the transfer function from quantum noise to the output port, so \n",
    "we can then directly combine this output with the transfer function computed in task 1 to get the *Quantum Noise Limited Sensitivity* of the interferometer:\n",
    "$$S_q(f) = \\frac{\\mathtt{out[`qn`]}}{|H_s(f)|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Noise sources: laser frequency noise\n",
    "\n",
    "Interferometers are also affected by **laser frequency noise**: the laser’s optical frequency is not perfectly constant in time, but oscillates slightly around its nominal (central) value. If the laser normally emits light at frequency $\\nu_0$, then applying a frequency modulation makes it vary as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\nu(t)= \n",
    "\\nu_0 + \\delta \\nu(t)= \n",
    "\\nu_0+  {A}  \\cdot \\sin (2 \\pi f_{\\text{sig}}t) $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where A is the modulation amplitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "A change $ \\nu(t)= \\nu_0+ \\delta \\nu(t) $ \n",
    "corresponds to a change in phase of the input field: \n",
    "$$ E_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) = \n",
    "E_0 e^{i(2\\pi \\nu_0 t + \\delta \\phi(t))}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\delta \\phi(t)= 2 \\pi A \\int \\sin (2 \\pi f_{\\text{sig}}t) dt = \n",
    "- \\dfrac{A}{ f_{\\text{sig}}} \\cos (2 \\pi f_{\\text{sig}}t)\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the interferometer output is determined by the interference between the beams returning from its two arms, fluctuations in the laser frequency alter the interference condition, and thus the detected signal."

    "# Introductory task: role of cavities\n",
    "\n",
    "Optical cavities are the fundamental building blocks of gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. In this section, we will briefly study their characteristics and explain their role. Understanding cavities is essential, as most of the interferometer configurations we will encounter in this tutorial rely on multiple cavities to enhance the detector’s sensitivity over a given frequency bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will consider a simple Fabry–Perot cavity. In this model, the Input Test Mass (ITM) and End Test Mass (ETM) form a cavity. The main purpose of these arm cavities is to increase the circulating power inside the interferometer arms and thereby amplify the GW signal. A passing gravitational wave changes the optical path length between the two test masses, producing sidebands on the laser light. The cavity acts as a resonant amplifier, enhancing these sidebands and making the signal measurable at the output port. \n",
    "\n",
    "In sumamry:\n",
    "1. Power Build-Up: Cavities resonate the carrier light, increasing the effective power inside the arms by a factor equal to the cavity finesse. This reduces shot noise and improves strain sensitivity.\n",
    "2. Signal amplification: By storing light for many round trips, the cavity amplifies the phase shift caused by GWs, effectively increasing the interferometer’s arm length (folding of arms).\n",
    "3. Frequency Shaping: Cavities act as filters, enhancing sensitivity in certain frequency bands (e.g., arm cavities set the cavity pole, which determines the frequency response).\n",
    "4. In advanced configurations, power and signal recycling cavities are added to further improve sensitivity and tailor the detector’s response."

If the cavity is resonant for the given laser frequency, the circulating power inside the cavity increases drastically, and correspondingly, the transmitted power also increases. At the same time, the reflected power drops. All of this follows from the principles of energy conservation and the resonance condition of the cavity.\n",

    "\n",
    "For laser frequency modulations with f << cavity pole, the cavity is able to follow the modulation perfectly, as seen from the transfer function above. However, for f >> cavity pole the cavity cannot respond quickly to the fluctuations, and a roll-off appears beyond the cavity pole.\n",

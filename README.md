# Finesse 3: Getting started

## Try without installing

We provide 2 ways to 'try before you buy'.
Both ways will stop your python session after some time, so it is not suitable as a substitute for installation. 
You can always download and save your work locally

### Google Colab

Click on the badge below to open this repository in Google Colab. 
You can then select either of the notebooks to open and run them.
This requires you to sign in to a Google account. 
You can save copies of the notebooks in Google Drive.

### Binder

Alternative that does not require a Google account. Can be slower to start up.
Creates a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) environment with Finesse 3 pre-installed.

## About

[Finesse 3](https://finesse.ifosim.org/docs/latest/) (Frequency domain INterfErometer Simulation SoftwarE) is a fast and easy to use Python-based interferometer simulation program. 
It uses frequency-domain optical modelling to build accurate quasi-static simulations of arbitrary interferometer configurations.

It contains the following examples:

* 1_Finesse3_introduction.ipynb
* 2_Finesse3_GWdetector_sensitivity.ipynb


## Get Finesse

If you decide to continue using Finesse, there are currently two options:

- [Finesse 3 installation instructions](https://finesse.ifosim.org/docs/latest/getting_started/install/index.html) for installing as a package
- [Finesse 3 developer guide](https://finesse.ifosim.org/docs/latest/developer/setting_up.html). for playing around with the source code

In either case, feel free to get in touch!

## Useful Resources

* [Finesse 3 homepage](https://finesse.ifosim.org/)
* [Finesse 3 documentation](https://finesse.ifosim.org/docs/latest/)
* [Finesse 3 source code](https://gitlab.com/ifosim/finesse/finesse3)

The review article [Interferometer Techniques for Gravitational-Wave Detection](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41114-016-0002-8) is written by some of the team behind Finesse and includes Finesse examples for many of the key topics covered. It is therefore a good resource for those wanting to understand more about interferometry as applied to gravitational-wave detection, and as implemented in Finesse.

## Contact

For support and questions, use our [chat channel](https://matrix.to/#/#finesse:matrix.org)

The [Ifosim logbooks](https://logbooks.ifosim.org/) provide a forum for users to share more examples and references of interferometry simulations, mostly generated in the course of gravitational-wave research. Posts are public; write-access is available for all GW community members via albert.einstein, and to others on request. <!-- link 'on request' somewhere? -->

General support is available by emailing us at finesse-support(at)nikhef.nl. If you have trouble with installation or think you have encountered a bug, please include the following information in your message:

* Operating System and installation method used
* versions of Finesse you are using
* [Minimum Working Example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_working_example) to reproduce the bug you encountered

## For maintainers

Note that this repo lives in two places:

- https://gitlab.com/ifosim/finesse/finesse3_getting_started
- https://github.com/gwoptics/finesse3_getting_started

The github exists only because it is required for Google Colab. 
The repository is mirrored from gitlab -> github.
All commits should be made on the gitlab repository and will be synchronised to the github repo.
You can start a manual synchronisation [here](https://gitlab.com/ifosim/finesse/finesse3_getting_started/-/settings/repository#js-push-remote-settings)
The github repo is configured to disallow any pushes. 
The mirroring depends on a [PAT](https://github.com/organizations/gwoptics/settings/personal-access-tokens/766651)
